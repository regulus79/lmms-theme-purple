# Deep Purple Theme for LMMS

This is my first LMMS theme! It's just a simple recoloring of the default LMMS theme to be more dark and purple.

## License

The base `style.css` is taken from the default LMMS theme with some modifications to make everything purple. All of the images contained in this repo are identical to the default theme images, just with the green HSV shifted to be purple. Therefore, I believe this theme must be licensed under GPLv2, just like LMMS. I have included a copy of GPLv2 in the `LICENSE.txt`.
